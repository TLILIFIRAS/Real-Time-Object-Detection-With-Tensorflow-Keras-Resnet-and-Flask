# Real-Time Object Detection with TensorFlow, Keras, ResNet, and Flask

This repository contains a real-time object detection project implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, ResNet, and Flask. The project captures video frames from a webcam feed, performs object detection using a pre-trained ResNet50 model, and displays the results in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained ResNet50 model
- Flask web application for streaming video feed with detection results
- User-friendly interface for viewing live object detection

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required environment and dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application and access the object detection video feed.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask web application code.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for rendering the video feed.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Flask app with `python app.py`.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL.
4. Enjoy the real-time object detection video feed!
